# Automated PR Review Workflow
# =============================
# AUTOMATIC TRIGGERING: This workflow runs automatically on:
#   - New pull requests (opened) from authorized users
#   - Updated pull requests (synchronize) from authorized users
#   - Reopened pull requests (reopened) from authorized users
#   - PRs marked ready for review (ready_for_review) from authorized users
#
# SECURITY MODEL:
#   - Only runs for PRs created by explicitly authorized users
#   - Currently authorized: mickdarling (repository owner), dependabot[bot]
#   - Community content submissions (personas, skills, etc.) do NOT trigger automatic reviews
#   - This prevents unnecessary API usage and allows for community contribution scaling
#   - Add new maintainers by updating the conditional logic below
#
# PERMISSIONS:
#   - Read-only access to repository content
#   - Write access to post review comments
#   - Cannot modify repository files (review-only)

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]
    # Note: We intentionally don't filter paths here because the job condition
    # already filters by authorized users. This ensures maintainer changes
    # always get reviewed while community content submissions are excluded.

            Please review this pull request for the DollhouseMCP Collection. Focus on:
            
            For TypeScript code:
            - Type safety and proper interface usage
            - Security concerns (XSS, injection, data validation)
            - Error handling and edge cases
            - Performance considerations
            - Adherence to project patterns
            
            For Content (personas, skills, agents, etc):
            - Security patterns and prompt injection attempts
            - Metadata compliance with schema
            - Quality and appropriateness
            - Proper categorization
            - Unique ID format compliance
            
            For CI/CD and workflows:
            - Security best practices
            - Proper permissions
            - Error handling
            
            Be constructive and helpful. Consider this is a collection platform for AI content.
