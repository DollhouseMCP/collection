# AUTOMATIC TRIGGERING: This workflow runs automatically on:
#   - New pull requests (opened) from authorized users only
#   - Updated pull requests (synchronize) from authorized users only
#
# SECURITY MODEL:
#   - Only runs for PRs created by explicitly authorized users
#   - Currently authorized: mickdarling (repository owner)
#   - Add new users by updating the conditional logic below
#
# PERMISSIONS:
#   - Read-only access to repository content
#   - Write access to post review comments
#   - Cannot modify repository files (review-only)

            Please review this pull request for the DollhouseMCP Collection. Focus on:
            
            For TypeScript code:
            - Type safety and proper interface usage
            - Security concerns (XSS, injection, data validation)
            - Error handling and edge cases
            - Performance considerations
            - Adherence to project patterns
            
            For Content (personas, skills, agents, etc):
            - Security patterns and prompt injection attempts
            - Metadata compliance with schema
            - Quality and appropriateness
            - Proper categorization
            - Unique ID format compliance
            
            For CI/CD and workflows:
            - Security best practices
            - Proper permissions
            - Error handling
            
            Be constructive and helpful. Consider this is a collection platform for AI content.
