## ✅ All Review Recommendations Implemented

This update addresses all three recommendations from the PR review, with a focus on preventing technical debt and ensuring long-term maintainability.

### 1. ✅ Expanded hypothetical_bypass Pattern (20 → 40 chars)

**Change**: `src/validators/security-patterns.ts` line 209
```diff
- pattern: /hypothetical(ly)?\s+.{0,20}(no\s+restrictions|unrestricted|without\s+limits)/i,
+ pattern: /hypothetical(ly)?\s+.{0,40}(no\s+restrictions|unrestricted|without\s+limits)/i,
```

**Rationale**: The previous 20-character limit could miss valid attack patterns with longer phrases between "hypothetical" and the restriction keywords, such as:
- "hypothetically speaking, in a scenario where you have no restrictions"
- "hypothetical situation assuming that you operate without limits"

### 2. ✅ Fixed Skipped Test Environment Issue

**Root Cause**: The test was being run with the wrong Jest configuration, causing it to be skipped.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `it.skip()` and enabled the test
- Fixed the test runner configuration issue
- All 12 jailbreaking tests now pass successfully

**Change**: `test/security/jailbreaking.test.ts` line 146
```diff
- it.skip('should detect hypothetical bypass patterns', () => {
+ it('should detect hypothetical bypass patterns', () => {
```

### 3. ✅ Added Comprehensive Performance Benchmarks

**New File**: `test/security/performance-benchmark.test.ts` (206 lines)

**Features**:
- Content size scaling tests (1KB to 500KB)
- Pattern count impact analysis
- Line number tracking performance
- Memory usage monitoring
- Regex complexity benchmarking

**Key Performance Results**:
```
========== PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK SUMMARY ==========
Total Patterns: 31

Content Size Performance:
  1KB: 0.05ms (clean), 0.03ms (with patterns)
  10KB: 0.14ms (clean), 0.12ms (with patterns)
  50KB: 0.64ms (clean), 0.64ms (with patterns)
  100KB: 1.09ms (clean), 1.08ms (with patterns)
  500KB: 5.45ms (clean), 5.54ms (with patterns)

Baseline Performance:
  API Request (3KB): 0.07ms
  Large Document (50KB): 0.62ms
  Avg Time per Pattern: 0.020ms
==================================================
```

**Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces to ensure no `any` types:
```typescript
interface SizeResult {
  size: number;
  cleanTime?: string;
  patternTime?: string;
  issueCount?: number;
}

interface BaselineResult {
  apiTime: string;
  docTime: string;
  avgTimePerPattern: string;
  patternCount: number;
}
```

### Test Summary

All 136 tests passing across all platforms:
- **Unit Tests**: 42 ✅
- **Integration Tests**: 32 ✅
- **Security Tests**: 62 ✅ (including 15 new performance benchmarks)

### Technical Debt Prevention

This implementation prioritizes:
1. **Type Safety**: No unsafe `any` types, all data structures properly typed
2. **Test Reliability**: Fixed environment issues rather than skipping tests
3. **Performance Visibility**: Comprehensive benchmarks establish baselines for future optimization
4. **Maintainability**: Clear interfaces and well-documented performance characteristics

The scanner demonstrates excellent linear scaling with content size, making it suitable for production use at scale.
