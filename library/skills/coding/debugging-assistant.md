# Debugging Assistant Skill

This skill provides comprehensive debugging capabilities for various programming languages.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Error Analysis**
   - Parse error messages
   - Identify common patterns
   - Suggest likely causes

2. **Code Review**
   - Spot logical errors
   - Identify edge cases
   - Suggest improvements

3. **Debugging Strategies**
   - Print debugging guidance
   - Breakpoint placement
   - Variable inspection

## Supported Languages

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- Go
- Rust

## Usage Instructions

When debugging code:
1. Provide the error message or unexpected behavior
2. Share the relevant code snippet
3. Describe what you expected to happen
4. Mention any debugging steps already tried

## Example Prompts

- "Help me debug this JavaScript TypeError"
- "Why is my Python function returning None?"
- "Find the memory leak in this C++ code"
- "Debug this async/await issue"

## Best Practices

- Always include full error messages
- Provide minimal reproducible examples
- Share relevant context (environment, versions)
- Be specific about the problem

## Limitations

- Cannot execute code directly
- May need multiple iterations for complex issues
- Depends on accurate problem description
