# Claude Review Status Check Setup

## Quick Summary
Transform Claude reviews from advisory to blocking by making the workflow fail when critical issues are found. Also enables manual triggering for community PRs.

## What We Implemented
1. **Status Check Blocking**: Claude can fail the workflow when issues found
2. **Manual Trigger**: Comment `@claude review` to review community PRs
3. **Branch Protection Ready**: Works with 0 required reviewers

## How It Works

### Automatic Reviews (Your PRs)
1. You create a PR
2. Claude automatically reviews (if you're in authorized users list)
3. If Claude finds critical issues ‚Üí workflow fails ‚ùå ‚Üí merge blocked
4. If Claude approves ‚Üí workflow passes ‚úÖ ‚Üí can merge

### Manual Reviews (Community PRs)
1. Community member creates PR
2. Claude doesn't auto-run (saves API costs)
3. You review content and comment `@claude review`
4. Claude runs and provides feedback
5. You decide to merge or request changes

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` - Added failure logic
2. `.github/workflows/claude-review-manual.yml` - Added manual trigger

### Key Code Added
```javascript
// In claude-review.yml - fails workflow if changes needed
if (reviewEvent === 'REQUEST_CHANGES') {
  core.setFailed('‚ùå Claude has requested changes. Please address the issues identified in the review above before merging.');
}
```

## Branch Protection Configuration

Go to **Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule**:

```yaml
Branch name pattern: main

‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  - Require approvals: 0
  - ‚úÖ Dismiss stale pull request approvals
  
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
  - Required status checks:
    - claude-review
    
‚ùå Include administrators (unchecked = allows override)
```

## Manual Review Trigger

Two ways to trigger Claude on any PR:

1. **Comment Method**: Type `@claude review` in the PR
   - You'll get a üöÄ reaction when it starts
   - Results appear as a new comment

2. **Actions Method**: 
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Select "Claude Review" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Enter PR number

## Community PR Workflow

1. Community creates PR
2. Required checks pending (blocking merge)
3. You review content manually first
4. If it looks good, comment `@claude review`
5. Claude runs and updates status check
6. Based on Claude + your review:
   - Both good ‚Üí merge
   - Issues found ‚Üí request changes
   - False positive ‚Üí admin override

## Keyword Detection

Claude will fail the workflow if it detects:
- Critical security issues
- Dangerous patterns
- Must-fix problems
- Errors or failures (excluding benign uses like "error handling")

## Troubleshooting

### Claude is too strict
- Adjust blocking keywords in the workflow
- Look for patterns like `/\b(critical|dangerous|must[\s-]fix)\b/`

### Need to merge anyway
- Use admin privileges (since "Include administrators" is unchecked)
- Shows as "Administrator merged this pull request"

### Community PR not running Claude
- Make sure to comment `@claude review`
- Check you're logged in as an authorized user
- Verify the PR is still open

### Status check not updating
- Check Actions tab for workflow runs
- Look for errors in the workflow logs
- Ensure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret is set

## Important Notes

- Only authorized users can trigger manual reviews
- Claude's decision is based on keyword analysis of its own review
- The fallback comment still works if PR creation fails
- Community PRs always require manual trigger to save API costs
