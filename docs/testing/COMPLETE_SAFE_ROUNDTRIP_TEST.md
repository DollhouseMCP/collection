## PART 1: Claude Desktop Setup (Start Here)

Start in Claude Desktop with these exact prompts:

### Prompt 1: Browse and Install from Collection
First, browse the skills available in the collection using: browse_collection "skills"

Then install the Safe Roundtrip Tester using: install_collection_element "skills/safe-roundtrip-tester.md"

Tell me if it downloaded successfully and what version it shows.

### Prompt 2: Verify Installation
Please list all skills in my portfolio using list_elements --type skills and tell me if you see "Safe Roundtrip Tester" in the list. Also tell me what version number it shows.

### Prompt 3: Check Current Configuration
Show me my current collection submission configuration using get_collection_submission_config and tell me if auto-submit is enabled or disabled.

### Prompt 4: Test WITHOUT Auto-Submit
First disable auto-submit by running: configure_collection_submission autoSubmit: false

Then verify it's disabled with: get_collection_submission_config

Finally, submit the Safe Roundtrip Tester to my portfolio using: submit_content "Safe Roundtrip Tester"

Tell me:
1. Was it uploaded to my GitHub portfolio?
2. What's the portfolio URL?
3. Was a collection issue created? (Should be NO)
4. Did you get a manual submission link?

### Prompt 5: Verify Portfolio Upload
Please check my GitHub portfolio and tell me if you can see the safe-roundtrip-tester.md file in the skills folder. What version does it show?

### Prompt 6: Make a Modification
Please modify the Safe Roundtrip Tester by using: edit_element "Safe Roundtrip Tester" --type skills version "1.0.1"

Also add a note at the end saying "Modified via Claude Desktop test on [today's date]"

Then verify the changes were saved by showing me the updated version.

### Prompt 7: Test WITH Auto-Submit
Now enable auto-submit by running: configure_collection_submission autoSubmit: true

Verify it's enabled with: get_collection_submission_config

Then submit the modified skill again using: submit_content "Safe Roundtrip Tester"

Tell me:
1. Was it updated in my GitHub portfolio?
2. Was a collection issue created this time?
3. What's the issue URL?
4. What labels were applied to the issue?

### Prompt 8: Test Error Handling
Try submitting a skill that doesn't exist: submit_content "This Skill Does Not Exist"

What error message did you get? Was it helpful?

### Prompt 9: Browse Collection Directly
Browse the skills in the collection using: browse_collection "skills"

Can you see other skills available? List the first 3 you see. Do you see the Safe Roundtrip Tester?

### Prompt 10: Search Collection
Search for test-related content in the collection using: search_collection "safe" or search_collection "roundtrip"

What results do you find? Do you see the Safe Roundtrip Tester skill?

### Prompt 11: Clean Install from Collection
Let's test installing a fresh skill from the collection. First, delete the local Safe Roundtrip Tester if it exists.

Then install it fresh using: install_collection_element "skills/safe-roundtrip-tester.md"

Did it download successfully? What version did you get?

### Prompt 12: Reset Configuration
Please disable auto-submit for normal use by running: configure_collection_submission autoSubmit: false

Then verify with: get_collection_submission_config

The test is complete. Please summarize what worked and what didn't.

## PART 2: Terminal Verification (Optional)

If you have a verification script, run it. Otherwise, manually check:

### Check Portfolio Directory
ls ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/safe-roundtrip-tester.md
cat ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/safe-roundtrip-tester.md | head -20

### Verify Version
grep "version:" ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/safe-roundtrip-tester.md

## PART 3: GitHub Verification

Open your browser and check:

### 1. Your Portfolio Repository
- Navigate to your GitHub portfolio repository
- Go to `/skills/safe-roundtrip-tester.md`
- Check the version number (should be 1.0.1 after modification)
- Check for the modification note you added

### 2. Collection Issues (if auto-submit was enabled)
- Go to the DollhouseMCP collection issues page
- Look for an issue titled "[skills] Add Safe Roundtrip Tester by @[your-username]"
- Check it has labels: `contribution`, `pending-review`, `skills`
- Verify the issue body contains your portfolio URL
