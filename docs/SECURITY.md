# Security Documentation

## Security First Approach

The DollhouseMCP Collection implements comprehensive security measures to protect users from malicious content, prompt injection, and other AI/LLM-specific threats. Every element undergoes rigorous security validation before acceptance.

## Security Features

### 🛡️ Multi-Layer Defense
- **Static Analysis** - Pattern-based threat detection
- **Dynamic Validation** - Runtime security checks
- **Manual Review** - Human oversight for high-risk content
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Automated daily scans

### 🔍 Threat Detection
- **48 Security Patterns** - Comprehensive threat coverage
- **197+ Security Tests** - Extensive test suite
- **Real-time Scanning** - < 0.1ms pattern matching
- **Zero False Negatives** - All known threats detected

## Security Categories

### 1. Prompt Injection Protection
Prevents attempts to override or manipulate AI instructions:
- Instruction overrides
- Context switching
- Role manipulation
- System prompt attacks

### 2. Jailbreaking Prevention
Blocks attempts to bypass safety constraints:
- DAN (Do Anything Now) patterns
- Constraint removal attempts
- Safety filter bypasses
- Ethical guideline violations

### 3. Command Execution Blocking
Prevents system command injection:
- Shell command execution
- File system operations
- Network requests
- Process manipulation

### 4. Data Exfiltration Detection
Identifies unauthorized data access attempts:
- Credential harvesting
- Personal information extraction
- API key exposure
- Database queries

### 5. Context Manipulation Prevention
Protects against memory and context attacks:
- Memory injection
- Context pollution
- State manipulation
- History tampering

## Security Validation Process

### Automated Scanning
Every submission undergoes automated security scanning:

```bash
# Run security validation
npm run validate:security library/new-element.md

# Full security audit
npm run security:audit
```

### Pattern Matching Engine
High-performance pattern matching with:
- Optimized regex patterns
- Early exit strategies
- ReDoS prevention
- Pattern prioritization

### Severity Classification

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Immediate security threat | Auto-reject |
| 🟠 **HIGH** | Potential security risk | Manual review |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Security concern | Warning issued |
| 🟢 **LOW** | Minor issue | Logged only |

## Security Patterns

### Critical Patterns (Blocked)
```text
❌ API Keys: sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx
❌ Credentials: password123
❌ Credit Cards: 4111-1111-1111-1111
❌ Private Keys: -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### High-Risk Patterns (Reviewed)
```text
⚠️ System Commands: exec(), system()
⚠️ File Operations: fs.readFile()
⚠️ Network Calls: fetch(), curl
⚠️ SQL Queries: SELECT * FROM
```

### Warning Patterns (Flagged)
```text
⚡ Email Addresses: user@example.com
⚡ Phone Numbers: +1-555-0123
⚡ IP Addresses: 192.168.1.1
⚡ URLs: http://example.com
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never Include Secrets**
   - No API keys or tokens
   - No passwords or credentials
   - No personal information
   - No production data

2. **Avoid Security Patterns**
   - Don't use injection keywords
   - Avoid command-like syntax
   - No system operation references
   - No database queries

3. **Use Placeholders**
   - `[API_KEY]` instead of real keys
   - `[USER_EMAIL]` for email examples
   - `[COMMAND]` for command references
   - `[PASSWORD]` for credentials

4. **Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   # Validate before submission
   npm run validate:content your-element.md
   ```

### For Reviewers

1. **Check Security Reports**
   - Review automated scan results
   - Verify pattern matches
   - Assess risk levels
   - Check for false positives

2. **Manual Inspection**
   - Look for obfuscated threats
   - Check encoded content
   - Review external references
   - Validate metadata

3. **Test in Isolation**
   - Run in sandboxed environment
   - Monitor system calls
   - Check network activity
   - Verify resource usage

## Security Incident Response

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Do NOT** share details publicly
3. **Email** security@dollhousemcp.com
4. **Include**:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **< 24 hours** - Initial acknowledgment
- **< 72 hours** - Vulnerability assessment
- **< 7 days** - Mitigation deployed
- **< 30 days** - Full resolution
