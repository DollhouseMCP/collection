# Session Plan: Security Infrastructure Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-15  
**Session**: 002  
**Topic**: Security Infrastructure

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Ported Security Infrastructure ✅
Successfully adapted and implemented security features from:
- DollhouseMCP MCP server
- DollhouseMCP Personas marketplace

### 2. GitHub Advanced Security Configuration ✅
Created comprehensive security setup:
- **Dependabot** configuration for automated updates
- **CodeQL** configuration for code analysis
- Security-focused query suites
- Proper path inclusions/exclusions

### 3. Automated Security Workflows ✅
Implemented 4 key workflows:

1. **security-scan.yml**
   - CodeQL analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Content security validation
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Daily scheduled runs

2. **content-security-validation.yml**
   - Validates all content types
   - PR commenting with reports
   - Blocks merge on critical issues
   - Manual validation support

3. **claude-review.yml**
   - AI-powered PR reviews
   - Authorized user control
   - Content and code quality checks
   - Adapted from MCP server

4. **update-pinned-actions.yml**
   - Monthly GitHub Actions updates
   - Commit SHA pinning for security
   - Automated PR creation

### 4. Integration with Existing Validators ✅
All workflows leverage the existing security patterns:
- 77+ prompt injection patterns
- 62+ YAML security patterns
- Command execution prevention
- Data exfiltration detection

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Reused Existing Patterns**: Leveraged security-patterns.ts instead of duplicating
2. **Multi-layered Security**: CodeQL + custom validation + dependency scanning
3. **Authorized Users Only**: Claude reviews restricted to repository owner
4. **Daily Security Scans**: Proactive vulnerability detection
5. **PR-blocking Security**: Critical/high issues prevent merge

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Enable GitHub Advanced Security features** in repository settings
2. **Configure branch protection** with security checks required
3. **Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** secret for Claude reviews
4. **Test security workflows** with example PRs

### Medium Priority
1. Create comprehensive documentation
2. Add more content examples (all 7 types)
3. Document security best practices for contributors

### Low Priority
1. MCP server integration for direct submissions
2. Performance optimization of validators
3. Security metrics dashboard

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# View security alerts (after enabling)
gh api /repos/DollhouseMCP/collection/code-scanning/alerts

# Test content validation locally
npm run validate library/**/*.md

# Create test PR for security validation
git checkout -b test-security
echo "Test security patterns" > test-content.md
git add test-content.md
git commit -m "test: security validation"
gh pr create --title "Test security validation" --body "Testing security workflows"
```

## Technical Notes

1. **CODEOWNERS Integration**: Security workflows respect CODEOWNERS for reviews
2. **Workflow Permissions**: All workflows use minimal required permissions
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with informative messages
4. **Performance**: Validation runs in parallel where possible

## Repository State

- **Files Added**: 6 (all in .github/)
- **Commits**: 1 (comprehensive security infrastructure)
- **Branch**: main (all changes pushed)
- **CI Status**: Workflows not yet run (need secrets)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Personas Marketplace** has excellent security patterns to build upon
2. **MCP Server** workflows provide good enterprise patterns
3. **GitHub Advanced Security** requires repository settings configuration
4. **Claude API** needs secret configuration before use

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All workflows passing
- [ ] Security alerts dashboard active
- [ ] First PR successfully reviewed by Claude
- [ ] Content validation blocking bad submissions
- [ ] Dependabot creating update PRs
