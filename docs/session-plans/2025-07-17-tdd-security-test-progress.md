# TDD Security Test Implementation Progress - July 17, 2025

## Executive Summary
Completed 4 of 8 planned PRs for comprehensive security test implementation using TDD approach. Successfully addressed PR review feedback including fixing a critical ReDoS vulnerability.

## Completed PRs

### PR #38 (Merged) - Fix Prompt Injection Tests
- Fixed 3 failing tests by updating `disregard_instructions` pattern
- Tightened pattern to require ending words (instructions/commands/directives/rules)
- Reviewer feedback: Tighten patterns to reduce false positives
- All 14 prompt injection tests passing

### PR #39 (Merged) - Safe Test Infrastructure  
- Created placeholder-based testing to avoid triggering security systems
- Added JSON schema validation with AJV
- Fixed 7 ESLint errors about unsafe `any` usage
- Added comprehensive error handling
- User feedback: "Type safety is so useful"

### PR #40 (Merged) - Jailbreaking Pattern Detection
- Added 6 jailbreaking test cases in `security-test-patterns.json`
- Created 3 new patterns: `remove_restrictions`, `hypothetical_bypass`, `roleplay_unrestricted`
- Enhanced `hypothetical_bypass` pattern from 20 to 40 chars lookbehind
- Fixed skipped test (was using wrong Jest configuration)
- Added comprehensive performance benchmarks (15 new tests)
- Performance: ~0.019ms average per pattern, excellent linear scaling
- Created issue #41 for future edge case enhancements

### PR #42 (Merged) - Command Execution Pattern Detection
- Added 3 new patterns: `os_command`, `sql_command`, `reverse_shell`
- Enhanced `file_operations` pattern to detect `dd` commands
- Created 17 comprehensive tests in `command-execution.test.ts`
- **Critical fix**: Resolved ReDoS vulnerability in `file_operations` pattern
  - Changed from unbounded repetition `*` to limited `{0,2}`
  - Used non-capturing groups for better performance
- Added inline regex documentation for all complex patterns
- Enhanced test documentation for obfuscation limitations
- Improved error descriptions for specificity

## Key Learnings

### 1. PR Review Process
- **Critical**: Push code changes + descriptive text together
- Reviewer doesn't see updates well if they're separate
- Comments alone don't trigger review notifications
- Even when done correctly, reviewers may miss some changes

### 2. Type Safety
- ESLint strict mode catches unsafe `any` types
- Always define interfaces for JSON data structures
- Use proper type assertions, not `as any`
- Type safety prevents runtime errors

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)**:
  - Avoid unbounded repetition with `*` or `+`
  - Use specific limits like `{0,2}` or `{1,5}`
  - Prefer non-capturing groups `(?:)` for performance
  - Test patterns with repeated input

### 4. Pattern Design
- Order matters - more specific patterns should come first
- Document complex regex with inline comments
- Consider obfuscation techniques (Base64, Unicode, concatenation)
- Balance detection accuracy with false positive reduction

## In Progress

### PR #5 - Data Exfiltration Pattern Detection
- Created `test/security/data-exfiltration.test.ts` with test structure
- Added 2 additional test cases (DE003, DE004) to `security-test-patterns.json`
- Existing patterns to test:
  - `send_data`: General data transmission
  - `email_data`: Email-based exfiltration
  - `post_request`: HTTP POST/PUT (currently under network_access)
  - `api_key_pattern`: Exposed secrets (currently under sensitive_data)
- Ready to implement additional patterns in next session

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
- **PR #6**: Context awareness to reduce false positives
- **PR #8**: Performance benchmarking and optimization (partially done in PR #40)

### Medium Priority  
- **PR #5**: Data exfiltration pattern detection (IN PROGRESS)

### Low Priority
- **PR #7**: Remaining security test categories
- **Issue #41**: Advanced AI jailbreaking edge cases

## Test Status
- Unit Tests: 42 passing ✅
- Integration Tests: 32 passing ✅
- Security Tests: 79 passing ✅
- **Total: 153 tests**

## Performance Metrics
From PR #40 benchmarks:
- Pattern count: 34
- Average time per pattern: ~0.019ms
- Content size scaling: Linear
- 3KB document: ~0.07ms
- 50KB document: ~0.62ms
- 500KB document: ~5.5ms

## Technical Decisions

### Pattern Categories
Current categories in use:
- `prompt_injection`: Instruction override attempts
- `jailbreak`: Safety/restriction bypass (not "jailbreaking")
- `command_execution`: OS/shell command execution
- `code_execution`: Code evaluation (eval, exec)
- `file_system`: File operations
- `network_access`: Network operations (curl, POST)
- `data_exfiltration`: Data leakage attempts
- `sensitive_data`: Exposed secrets/keys
- `role_hijacking`: Identity/role changes
- `privilege_escalation`: Permission elevation
- `obfuscation`: Encoding/hiding attempts
- `yaml_security`: YAML-specific vulnerabilities
- `resource_exhaustion`: DoS attempts

### Testing Strategy
1. **Mock Scanner**: Safe development with placeholders
2. **Real Scanner**: Integration testing with actual patterns
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure sub-second response times
4. **Edge Cases**: Document limitations for future work

## Next Session Plan
1. Complete PR #5 - Data Exfiltration:
   - Add patterns for webhook/callback URLs
   - Add patterns for cloud storage (S3, GDrive, Dropbox)
   - Add patterns for database operations (dump, export)
   - Add patterns for file transfer protocols (FTP, SCP)
   - Consider GraphQL query exfiltration
2. Start PR #6 - Context Awareness (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. Continue with remaining PRs

## Important Reminders
- Always run `npm run lint` before committing
- Test with `npm run test:all` before creating PR
- Include comprehensive PR descriptions
- Watch for ReDoS vulnerabilities in regex patterns
- Maintain type safety throughout
