# Session Summary - Integration Tests Work

## Sessions Completed
1. **2025-07-16-001**: PR #10 merge, Integration test creation
2. **2025-07-16-002**: Test fixes, Claude feedback, Windows issue

## Key Achievements
- Created 1,525+ lines of integration tests
- Fixed all test failures on Unix platforms
- Implemented all code review feedback
- Maintained code quality (0 lint errors)

## Current Blocker
**Windows CLI Tests**: All 12 CLI tests fail due to Node.js spawn issue
- Likely fix: Add `shell: true` for Windows
- Alternative: Use cross-spawn package

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always check all platforms** - Don't assume Unix success means Windows works
2. **Security patterns matter** - This project focuses on AI security, not web security
3. **Document thoroughly** - Created multiple reference docs for continuity
4. **Address all feedback** - Implemented every suggestion from Claude's review

## Quick Reference for Next Session
```bash
# The fix will likely be in this file around line 30:
test/integration/cli-validation.test.ts

# The simple fix to try first:
shell: process.platform === 'win32'
```
