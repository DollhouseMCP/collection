# CLI Windows Test Fix Status - July 16, 2025

## Current Status
Working on PR #27 - Integration test suite. All tests pass on Linux/macOS but fail on Windows.

## The Problem
- All 12 CLI tests fail on Windows with exit code 0 and empty output
- The issue is that `spawn()` doesn't properly execute Node.js scripts with shebangs on Windows
- Tried many approaches with spawn, all failed

## What We Tried (All Failed)
1. Basic spawn with 'node'
2. Adding `shell: true` for Windows
3. Using cross-spawn package
4. Using process.execPath
5. Normalizing paths to forward slashes  
6. Using windowsVerbatimArguments
7. Various stdio configurations
8. Explicit shell: bash configurations

## Solution In Progress
**Switching from spawn to direct module import approach:**

1. ✅ Modified `src/cli/validate-content.ts` to:
   - Export the `main()` function
   - Accept optional args parameter
   - Return exit code instead of calling process.exit
   
2. ✅ Updated test to:
   - Import the CLI module directly
   - Mock console.log/console.error to capture output
   - Call main() function instead of spawning process

3. ❌ Still need to fix:
   - Line 372 in cli-validation.test.ts still uses spawn for JSON report test
   - Need to update that test to use the new approach

## Next Steps
1. Fix the remaining spawn usage at line 372
2. Test locally to ensure all tests pass
3. Commit and push to see if Windows CI passes
4. If successful, mark task as complete

## Key Learning
The DollhouseMCP server repo showed us they avoid spawn issues by:
- Using strict security controls
- Direct module imports for testing
- Proper path normalization
- But ultimately, importing modules directly is more reliable than spawning for cross-platform CLI testing

## File Locations
- CLI source: `src/cli/validate-content.ts`
- Test file: `test/integration/cli-validation.test.ts`
- Problem line: 372 (JSON report test still using spawn)
