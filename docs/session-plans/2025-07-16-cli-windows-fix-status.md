# CLI Windows Test Fix Status - July 16, 2025

## ✅ RESOLVED - All Tests Passing

Successfully fixed Windows CLI test failures in PR #27. All 32 integration tests now pass on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## The Problem (Resolved)
- All 12 CLI tests were failing on Windows with exit code 0 and empty output
- The issue was that `spawn()` doesn't properly execute Node.js scripts with shebangs on Windows
- Tried many approaches with spawn, all failed

## What We Tried (All Failed)
1. Basic spawn with 'node'
2. Adding `shell: true` for Windows
3. Using cross-spawn package
4. Using process.execPath
5. Normalizing paths to forward slashes  
6. Using windowsVerbatimArguments
7. Various stdio configurations
8. Explicit shell: bash configurations

## Solution Implemented ✅
**Successfully switched from spawn to direct module import approach:**

1. ✅ Modified `src/cli/validate-content.ts` to:
   - Export the `main()` function
   - Accept optional args parameter
   - Return exit code instead of calling process.exit
   - Fixed `process.exit(1)` call to `return 1` for no files found case
   
2. ✅ Updated all tests to:
   - Import the CLI module directly
   - Mock console.log/console.error to capture output
   - Call main() function instead of spawning process
   - Handle environment variables (OUTPUT_FILE) directly

3. ✅ Fixed JSON report test:
   - Replaced spawn usage at line 372
   - Used direct function call with environment variable manipulation
   - Properly restore original environment after test

## Commit Details
- Commit: e6f26c6
- Branch: feat/integration-tests
- All 32 integration tests passing
- Ready for CI to verify cross-platform compatibility

## Key Learning
The DollhouseMCP server repo showed us they avoid spawn issues by:
- Using strict security controls
- Direct module imports for testing
- Proper path normalization
- But ultimately, importing modules directly is more reliable than spawning for cross-platform CLI testing

## File Locations
- CLI source: `src/cli/validate-content.ts`
- Test file: `test/integration/cli-validation.test.ts`
- Problem line: 372 (JSON report test still using spawn)
