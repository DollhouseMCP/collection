# Session Progress Report: CI/CD Test Fixes for PR #19
**Date:** 2025-07-15
**Session:** 004
**Topic:** Fixing CI/CD test failures and implementing missing validation features

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### Starting Situation
- PR #19 had massive CI/CD failures
- Tests weren't even running due to configuration issues
- Multiple layers of problems: linting, module resolution, missing features

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. ESLint Errors (SOLVED)
- Fixed unused variables in catch blocks
- Added missing eslint.config.js for ESLint v9
- Resolved all linting errors blocking the build

#### 2. Module Resolution (SOLVED)
- Fixed Jest configuration to handle .js extensions in imports
- Added moduleNameMapper to all Jest configs
- Tests can now properly import ES modules

#### 3. CI/CD Configuration (SOLVED)
- Fixed performance test to use ES modules (.mjs)
- Added proper GitHub Actions permissions for PR comments
- Updated Claude bot action to use @beta tag

#### 4. Test Data Issues (SOLVED)
- Fixed field names: created_at → created_date, updated_at → updated_date
- Added missing 'category' field to all test personas
- Fixed YAML date parsing (now accepts both string and Date objects)

#### 5. Missing Validation Features (IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ Empty content detection
- ✅ Content length validation (50KB limit)
- ✅ Lorem ipsum placeholder detection
- ✅ Better error messages for missing fields

### Test Progress
- **Started:** Everything broken, couldn't run tests
- **Ended:** 26 tests passing, only 4 failing

## 📋 Remaining Tasks for Next Session

### 1. Fix Remaining 4 Test Failures
Need to investigate why these specific tests are still failing:
- Skill validation tests
- Agent/Prompt/Template/Tool validation tests
- Ensemble validation tests

### 2. Verify CI/CD Pipeline
- Check if all GitHub Actions are now green
- Ensure Claude bot reviews are working
- Verify coverage reporting

### 3. Clean Up
- Remove the old content-validator.test.ts.old file
- Consider porting any valuable test cases from it

### 4. Documentation
- Update test documentation
- Document the validation rules implemented

## 🔑 Key Learnings

1. **Module Resolution:** Jest with TypeScript and ES modules requires careful configuration
2. **YAML Parsing:** The gray-matter library converts ISO dates to Date objects
3. **TDD Success:** The tests were actually well-written - they revealed missing features
4. **Incremental Progress:** Fixed issues one at a time, testing after each change

## 📝 Technical Details to Remember

1. **Build Output:** TypeScript compiles to `dist/src/` not just `dist/`
2. **Jest Config:** The moduleNameMapper regex `'^(\\.{1,2}/.*)\\.js$': '$1'` strips .js extensions
3. **Validation Types:** Tests expect specific error types (e.g., 'content_too_long' not 'file_too_large')
4. **Date Handling:** Use `z.union([z.string(), z.date()])` for date fields in Zod schemas

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Run `npm run test:unit` and investigate the 4 remaining failures
2. Check PR #19 on GitHub to see if CI/CD is now passing
3. Address any remaining Claude bot review comments
4. Prepare PR #19 for final merge

Great progress today - from completely broken to nearly working! 🎉
