# Session Plans

This directory contains planning documents from each development session on the DollhouseMCP Collection project.

## Naming Convention

Files are named with the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-topic.md`

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` - Date of the session
- `NNN` - Session number for that day (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- `topic` - Brief description of the session focus

This ensures proper ordering even with multiple sessions per day.
