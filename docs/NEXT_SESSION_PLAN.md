# DollhouseMCP Collection - Next Session Plan

## Session Summary (July 15, 2025)

### What We Accomplished
1. ✅ Created new repository: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/collection
2. ✅ Set up dual licensing with Ulysses Pacts (mirroring MCP server protections)
3. ✅ Established directory structure for 7 content types across 3 areas
4. ✅ Ported core validation system from personas marketplace
5. ✅ Fixed ensemble concept (collections of other content, not standalone)
6. ✅ Added MCP server integration documentation
7. ✅ Created example content (Creative Writer persona, Full-Stack Developer Ensemble)

### Repository Status
- Main branch has 4 commits
- Basic CI workflow created (validate-content.yml)
- Security validation system ported and adapted
- TypeScript structure ready for development

## Critical Next Steps

### 1. Security Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Reference**: DollhouseMCP server's comprehensive security implementation

- [ ] Port GitHub Advanced Security configuration
- [ ] Enable CodeQL scanning
- [ ] Set up Dependabot (security + version updates)
- [ ] Configure secret scanning with push protection
- [ ] Port security patterns and validation rules
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Add signature verification for releases

**Key Files to Reference from MCP Server**:
- `.github/dependabot.yml`
- `.github/workflows/` (all security-related workflows)
- `src/security/` directory
- Security implementation PRs (#135, #136, #156)

### 2. GitHub Automation Setup
**Reference**: MCP server's Claude bot integration and workflows

- [ ] Set up Claude bot for PR reviews
- [ ] Configure authorized users (mickdarling)
- [ ] Port issue templates from MCP server
- [ ] Set up project board automation
- [ ] Configure milestone structure

**Key Components**:
- Claude review workflow
- Issue-to-PR automation
- Authorized user controls
- YAML validation composite action

### 3. Branch Protection & CI/CD
**Reference**: MCP server's branch protection configuration

- [ ] Enable branch protection on main
- [ ] Require all status checks to pass
- [ ] Set up required workflows:
  - Core Build & Test
  - Security Validation
  - Content Validation
  - Cross-platform testing
- [ ] Configure PR review requirements
- [ ] Set up auto-merge rules

**Success Criteria**: 100% CI reliability before enabling protection

### 4. Development Workflow
**Standard Process** (from MCP server):
1. Create feature branch with descriptive name
2. Make focused changes
3. Comprehensive commit messages
4. Create PR with detailed description
5. Address review feedback
6. Create follow-up issues for suggestions
7. Merge when approved

**PR Best Practices** (from PR_BEST_PRACTICES.md):
- Include problem statement
- Root cause analysis
- Solution description
- Testing notes
- Related issues

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Port Jest configuration enhancements
- [ ] Create unit tests for validators
- [ ] Add integration tests for CLI tools
- [ ] Set up CI environment tests
- [ ] Configure coverage reporting

### 6. Documentation Completion
- [ ] API documentation for validators
- [ ] MCP integration guide
- [ ] Security implementation details
- [ ] Contributor onboarding guide
- [ ] Architecture overview

### 7. Content Migration
- [ ] Identify quality personas from marketplace
- [ ] Run through new validation system
- [ ] Organize into showcase/library
- [ ] Create more example ensembles
- [ ] Add variety of content types

### 8. MCP Server Integration
**Future Features**:
- `create_content` tool
- `validate_content` tool  
- `submit_to_collection` tool
- Direct PR creation from chat
- Automated security scanning

## Technical Debt & Considerations

### From MCP Server Lessons:
1. **Path Resolution**: Use process.cwd() not __dirname for CI compatibility
2. **TypeScript**: Ensure Windows compatibility with type declarations
3. **Regex Security**: Apply length limits to prevent ReDoS
4. **Workflow Permissions**: Explicit permissions on all workflows
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with helpful messages

### Security Patterns to Port:
- SEC-001: Prompt injection protection
- SEC-003: YAML parsing security
- SEC-004: Token management
- SEC-005: Docker hardening (if applicable)

## Repository Configuration Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Advanced Security enabled
- [ ] Branch protection configured
- [ ] Required status checks defined
- [ ] PR templates created
- [ ] Issue templates configured
- [ ] Milestones established
- [ ] Project board created
