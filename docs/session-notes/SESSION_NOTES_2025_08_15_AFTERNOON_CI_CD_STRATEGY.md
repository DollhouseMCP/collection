# Session Notes - August 15, 2025 - Afternoon CI/CD Strategy & Infrastructure Planning

## Session Overview
**Date**: Friday, August 15, 2025  
**Time**: ~3:00 PM - 4:30 PM EST
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Focus**: CI/CD strategy, GitOps implementation, Node.js version management
**Result**: ✅ Major strategic planning completed with 11 issues created

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Merged PR #125 - TypeScript Refactor
- Successfully merged after fixing all CI issues
- Fixed unused variable declarations
- Fixed performance test thresholds
- Fixed Windows path separator issues
- All tests passing on all platforms

### 2. ✅ Created Comprehensive CI/CD Strategy
Documented the fundamental difference between Collection and MCP Server:
- **Collection**: GitHub-hosted infrastructure → Future cloud deployment (Ubuntu only)
- **MCP Server**: User machines (cross-platform) → Also future cloud deployment

### 3. ✅ Created 11 Strategic Issues

#### Collection Repository Issues:
- **#126**: Research OAuth interaction with GitHub-hosted vs self-hosted Collection (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **#127**: Implement GitOps branching and deployment environments
- **#128**: Optimize Collection CI for Ubuntu-only testing
- **#129**: Cloud enclave integration (reference only)
- **#130**: [FUTURE] Cloud deployment simulation tests
- **#131**: Update GitFlow Guardian and handle Dependabot for GitOps workflow
- **#132**: Node.js version strategy and @types/node alignment

#### MCP Server Repository Issues:
- **#607**: Research Streamable HTTP transport implementation
- **#608**: [FUTURE] OAuth 2.1 implementation

### 4. ✅ Established GitOps Strategy
- **Branches ≠ Environments** (modern approach)
- Created `develop` branch for Collection
- Branches: main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*
- Environments: production, staging, development
- Environments are deployment targets, not code branches

### 5. ✅ Handled Dependabot PRs
**Merged:**
- PR #115: @typescript-eslint/parser update ✅
- PR #110: @jest/globals update ✅
- PR #102: eslint update ✅

**Not Merged:**
- PR #111: @types/node v24 (failing - needs Node 22 first)
- PR #67: Jest v30 (conflicts - closed)

### 6. ✅ Identified Node.js Version Issue
- Current: Node 20 (maintenance mode)
- Target: Node 22 (Active LTS)
- Problem: @types/node v24 doesn't work with Node 20 runtime
- Solution: Update to Node 22 first, then update types

### 7. ✅ Tested Node 22 Compatibility
- Created test branch with Node 22
- All tests passing locally
- Created PR #133 (closed due to conflicts)
- Node 22 is ready to go when we want to upgrade

## Key Architectural Insights

### Future Architecture Vision
```
Local Tier: MCP Server (Streamable HTTP) → User's Local LLM
     ↓
Cloud Bridge Tier: Cloud Enclave VMs → Bridge LLMs (Premium)
     ↓
Cloud Services Tier: MCP Server (HTTP/OAuth) → Premium Content
     ↓
Infrastructure Tier: Collection Servers → Global CDN
     ↓
Interface Tier: Website → End Users
```

### Protocol Evolution
- Moving from stdio to **Streamable HTTP** (March 2025 MCP spec)
- OAuth 2.1 integration for both local and cloud
- Single codebase for both deployment modes
- No dual maintenance of protocols

### Collection Future
- Multiple global servers
- Regional content filtering
- User permission granularity
- OAuth-based authentication
- Separate from GitHub infrastructure

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Ubuntu-only CI for Collection** - It only runs on GitHub/cloud servers
2. **Keep cross-platform CI for MCP Server** - Runs on user machines
3. **GitOps approach** - Environments are deployment targets, not branches
4. **Node 22 upgrade path** - Move to Active LTS, match types to runtime
5. **Streamable HTTP** - Future protocol for both local and cloud
6. **Cloud enclave** - Keep details in experimental repo only

## Sprint Planning

### Current Sprint (Rest of Today)
- ✅ Created all strategic issues
- ✅ Set up develop branch
- ✅ Handled Dependabot PRs

### Next Sprint (MCP Server Focus)
- Complete current MCP Server work
- Research Streamable HTTP migration
- Plan OAuth implementation

### Following Sprint (Collection GitOps)
- Implement GitFlow branching properly
- Set up deployment environments
- Create staging/production pipeline
- Update GitFlow Guardian hooks

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Node 22 Upgrade** - Ready but needs clean PR from develop
2. **Dependabot Configuration** - Should target develop, not main
3. **GitFlow Guardian** - Needs updates for new branch strategy
4. **CI Optimization** - Remove unnecessary cross-platform tests

## Lessons Learned

1. **Performance tests in CI are problematic** - Too much variation
2. **Types should match runtime** - Node 20 runtime needs v20 types
3. **GitOps is the modern way** - Branches for code, environments for deployment
4. **Collection is infrastructure** - Not user software, different CI needs

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Get on develop branch
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/collection
git checkout develop
git pull

# Check issue status
gh issue list --limit 20

# Update Node to 22 (when ready)
# Already tested and working, just needs clean PR

# Check Dependabot PRs
gh pr list --author "dependabot[bot]"
```

## Outstanding Work

1. Create clean Node 22 upgrade PR from develop
2. Configure Dependabot to target develop
3. Update GitFlow Guardian for new workflow
4. Start Collection CI optimization (Ubuntu-only)
5. Begin MCP Server Streamable HTTP research

## Session Success Metrics

- ✅ 11 strategic issues created
- ✅ PR #125 merged successfully
- ✅ GitOps strategy documented
- ✅ Node 22 compatibility verified
- ✅ CI/CD separation strategy defined
- ✅ 3 Dependabot PRs merged
- ✅ develop branch created

## Final Status

This was an extremely productive session! We:
- Fixed and merged the TypeScript refactor
- Created a comprehensive CI/CD strategy
- Set up GitOps workflow foundation
- Handled dependency updates
- Prepared for Node 22 upgrade
- Documented clear separation between Collection and MCP Server needs

The groundwork is now laid for modernizing both repositories' CI/CD pipelines while respecting their different deployment targets and requirements.
