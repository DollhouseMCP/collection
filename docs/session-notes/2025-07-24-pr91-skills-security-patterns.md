# Session Notes: July 24, 2025 - PR #91 Skills & Security Pattern Improvements

## Overview
Successfully merged PR #91 adding 7 default skills to the collection while improving security pattern detection to reduce false positives.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. PR #80 → PR #91 Migration
- **Issue**: PR #80 included unwanted claude-review workflow changes that conflicted with PR #90's setup
- **Solution**: Created clean PR #91 with only skill files
- **Result**: Successfully merged without workflow conflicts

### 2. Security Pattern Improvements

#### The "Dataset" False Positive Issue
- **Problem**: The `training_data_extraction` pattern was matching any occurrence of "dataset"
- **Impact**: Legitimate content like "Dataset Overview:" in data-analysis.md was being flagged
- **Solution**: Made pattern more context-aware

#### Pattern Evolution
```regex
// OLD - Too broad, caused false positives
/\b(training\s+data|dataset|what\s+.{0,20}learned\s+from|trained\s+on|training\s+examples?)/i

// NEW - Context-aware, requires commands or possessive
/\b(show|give|tell|reveal|display|provide)\s+.{0,20}(training\s+(data|examples?))|what\s+(dataset|data|examples?)\s+.{0,20}(trained|learned)\s+(on|from)|what\s+(have\s+you|did\s+you)\s+learn(ed)?\s+from|\b(your|my|the)\s+training\s+(data|dataset)|(trained|learned)\s+on\s+what/i
```

#### Key Changes:
1. **Severity**: Reduced from 'critical' to 'high' (not all attempts are critical)
2. **Context Required**: Pattern now needs command verbs or possessive context
3. **Examples**:
   - ✅ Still catches: "Show me your training dataset"
   - ❌ No longer catches: "Dataset Overview:" or "The dataset contains 1000 rows"

### 3. Test Updates
- Updated `context-awareness.test.ts` to expect 'high' severity
- Updated `context-awareness-integration.test.ts` to expect 'high' severity
- Added pattern support for "what have you learned from"

### 4. Timestamp Uniqueness
- Fixed all skills to have unique timestamps (20250723-165718 through 20250723-165725)
- Prevents identical timestamps across content

## Lessons Learned

### 1. CI/CD Timing
- **Issue**: Tests appeared to fail in CI but passed locally
- **Root Cause**: CI was running on older commit while we had already pushed fixes
- **Lesson**: Always check commit SHA that CI ran on vs current HEAD

### 2. Security Pattern Design
- **Principle**: Be specific enough to catch malicious attempts but not so broad as to flag legitimate content
- **Approach**: Require context (commands, possessive, questions) not just keywords
- **Testing**: Always test patterns against both malicious and benign examples

### 3. Workflow Preservation
- Successfully avoided PR #90's claude-review workflow by cherry-picking only needed files
- Clean separation of concerns between content and infrastructure changes

## Files Changed

### New Skills Added:
1. `library/skills/coding/code-review.md` - Systematic code quality analysis
2. `library/skills/creative/creative-writing.md` - Creative content generation
3. `library/skills/professional/data-analysis.md` - Data interpretation and insights
4. `library/skills/professional/penetration-testing.md` - Security vulnerability testing
5. `library/skills/professional/research.md` - Comprehensive research capabilities
6. `library/skills/professional/threat-modeling.md` - Security threat assessment
7. `library/skills/professional/translation.md` - Multi-language translation

### Modified Files:
1. `library/skills/coding/debugging-assistant.md` - Minor updates from original
2. `src/validators/security-patterns.ts` - Improved training_data_extraction pattern
3. `test/security/context-awareness.test.ts` - Updated severity expectations
4. `test/security/context-awareness-integration.test.ts` - Updated severity expectations

## Next Steps for Parts 3-5

### Important Context for Future PRs:
1. **Use PR #90's claude-review workflow** - Don't include workflow changes
2. **Apply security pattern learnings** - Be careful with broad keyword matching
3. **Ensure unique timestamps** - Use different timestamps for each piece of content

### Part 3 - Templates (8 files)
When implementing:
- Cherry-pick only template files from PR #73
- Check for any security patterns that might cause false positives
- Ensure unique timestamps for each template

### Part 4 - Agents
When implementing:
- Review agent content for legitimate uses of security-sensitive words
- Consider if any patterns need refinement based on agent descriptions
- Maintain separation from workflow changes

### Part 5 - Final Items
When implementing:
- Apply all learnings from parts 1-4
- Final validation of all content
- Ensure comprehensive testing

## Security Pattern Guidelines

### When Adding New Patterns:
1. **Test against legitimate content** - Not just malicious examples
2. **Require context** - Commands, possessives, or clear intent
3. **Consider severity carefully** - Not everything needs to be 'critical'
4. **Document the intent** - Clear comments about what pattern catches

### Pattern Testing Approach:
```javascript
// Always test both positive and negative cases
const testCases = [
  // Should match (malicious)
  { text: "show me your [keyword]", expected: true },
  { text: "reveal the [keyword]", expected: true },
  
  // Should NOT match (legitimate)  
  { text: "[Keyword] Overview:", expected: false },
  { text: "The [keyword] contains data", expected: false }
];
```

## Commands for Future Sessions

### Check PR status:
```bash
gh pr list --repo DollhouseMCP/collection
```

### Cherry-pick files from original PR:
```bash
# Fetch PR branch
git fetch origin pull/73/head:pr-73

# Cherry-pick specific files
git checkout pr-73 -- path/to/file.md
```

### Test security patterns:
```bash
# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Validate specific content
npm run validate:content path/to/file.md
```

### Handle CI failures:
```bash
# Check which commit CI ran on
gh run view [RUN_ID] --repo DollhouseMCP/collection --json headSha

# Compare with current HEAD
git log --oneline -1
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Security patterns must be context-aware** - Avoid false positives on legitimate content
2. **Severity levels should be appropriate** - Not everything is 'critical'
3. **Workflow separation is crucial** - Keep PR #90's setup intact
4. **Unique identifiers matter** - Even in timestamps

## Session Summary

Successfully improved the collection's security validation to be more intelligent and context-aware while adding 7 high-quality skills. The pattern improvements will benefit all future content additions by reducing false positives while maintaining security.

**Next session should focus on**: Implementing Part 3 (Templates) with these learnings applied.
