# Session Notes - August 14, 2025 - Roundtrip Testing Setup

## Session Context
**Time**: Afternoon session
**Focus**: Setting up rigorous MCP roundtrip workflow testing
**Starting Context**: ~85% remaining

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. PR #116 Successfully Merged ✅
- **PR**: GitHub Actions workflows for roundtrip element submission
- **Lines Added**: 10,895 across 29 files
- **Workflows**: 2 comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows
- **Validation Scripts**: 10+ scripts for security, quality, integration

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration Success ✅
Successfully demonstrated Opus + Named Sonnet Agents pattern:

**Round 1 Agents:**
- 🔧 **LintFixer Leo** - Fixed 40 ESLint errors
- ✅ **Inspector Isaac** - Verified all fixes

**Round 2 Agents:**
- 🔧 **VariableFixer Victor** - Fixed CodeQL findings and Node versions  
- 📝 **IssueCreator Ivan** - Created tracking issues #117-119
- ✅ **FinalReviewer Felix** - Validated everything ready for merge

### 3. Test Infrastructure Created ✅

#### Test Skill Element
Created `roundtrip-test-validator.md`:
- Specialized skill for workflow validation
- Contains test markers for each step verification
- Pushed to GitHub main branch
- Path: `library/skills/roundtrip-test-validator.md`

#### Test Documentation
Created two comprehensive test guides:
1. **MCP_ROUNDTRIP_TEST_GUIDE.md** - General testing guide
2. **RIGOROUS_ROUNDTRIP_TEST.md** - Exact copy/paste commands

## Current Testing Status

### Test Element Details
- **Name**: Roundtrip Test Validator
- **Type**: skill
- **Unique ID**: `skill_roundtrip-test-validator_dollhousemcp-test_20250814-170000`
- **Status**: Pushed to GitHub, available in collection

### Test Progress
1. ✅ **Browse Collection**: Found skill in listing (also found existing roundtrip-test-skill)
2. ❌ **Search Function**: Not finding results (search may need different approach)
3. ❌ **Get Content**: Security system blocking access (detected shell commands in backticks)
4. 🔄 **Alternative Found**: `roundtrip-test-skill.md` works without security issues

## Key Issues Discovered

### Security System Blocking
- The `roundtrip-test-validator.md` contains content that triggers security warnings
- System detects "Shell command in backticks" as critical threat
- This is likely due to code examples in the skill documentation

### Search Functionality
- Search not returning expected results for "roundtrip test validator"
- May need exact matching or different query format
- Browse function works, search needs investigation

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Testing** with alternative `roundtrip-test-skill.md`
2. **Fix Security Issue** in validator skill (remove problematic backticks)
3. **Test Installation** to local portfolio
4. **Test Submission** back to collection
5. **Verify GitHub Issue** creation
