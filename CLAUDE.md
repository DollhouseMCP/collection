#### PR #5 - Zod v3.24.1 → v4.0.5 ✅ SOLVED
**Solution Found**: One-line backward compatibility fix
```typescript
// Line 237 in src/validators/content-validator.ts
const isMissingField = err.code === 'invalid_type' && 
  (('received' in err && err.received === 'undefined') || 
   (!('received' in err) && err.message.includes('received undefined')));
```
**Status**: Ready to merge with this fix applied

#### PR #2 - GitHub Action Update (peter-evans/create-pull-request)

4. ✅ PR #42: Command execution patterns
5. ✅ PR #43: Data exfiltration patterns
6. ✅ PR #45: Context awareness patterns
7. ✅ PR #48: Remaining categories
8. ✅ PR #50: Performance optimization **[FINAL - MERGED]**

### High Priority Tasks (GitHub Issues)
1. **Issue #32**: Fix library content validation issues (5 files)
2. **Issue #33**: Write comprehensive security tests ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Issue #34**: Create proper CLI validation tool with enhanced features

### Medium Priority Tasks (From Claude Reviews)
1. **Issue #28**: Improve CLI test robustness with timeouts
2. **Issue #29**: Make security test assertions more specific
3. **Issue #30**: Add flexible content validation handling
4. **Issue #31**: Clean up magic numbers

### Key Technical Context

#### Windows CLI Fix Pattern (PR #27)
Instead of using spawn() which fails on Windows:
```typescript
// Import and call directly
import { main as validateContent } from '../../dist/src/cli/validate-content.js';
const exitCode = await validateContent(args);
```

#### Security Pattern Context
This project detects AI/LLM security issues, NOT traditional web security:
- ✅ Prompt injection, command execution, jailbreaking
- ❌ SQL injection, XSS, traditional vulnerabilities

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr list

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Check failing library content
npm run validate:content library/**/*.md

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:security

# Run specific security test
npm run test:security -- test/security/data-exfiltration.test.ts

# Check for ReDoS vulnerabilities
# Look for patterns with *, +, or {n,} without upper bounds
grep -E '(\*|\+|\{[0-9]+,\})' src/validators/security-patterns.ts
```

### Session History
- **July 16 AM**: Fixed Windows CLI tests, created follow-up issues
- **July 16 PM**: Investigated Dependabot PRs, solved Zod v4 compatibility
- **July 17 AM**: Implemented TDD security tests (PRs #38-40, #42), fixed ReDoS vulnerability
- **July 17 PM**: Completed PRs #43, #45, #48 - 173 security tests passing!
- **July 17 FINAL**: 🎉 **COMPLETED 8/8 Security Series** - Merged PR #50 with production robustness

### Next Session Focus
1. **Issue #32** - Fix library content validation issues (5 files) ✅ FIXED in PR #57
2. **Issue #34** - Create proper CLI validation tool with enhanced features
3. **Dependabot PRs** - Review and merge (#1, #2) when time permits (#5 already closed)

## July 18, 2025 Session - Branch Protection & Security Strategy

### Key Accomplishments
1. ✅ **PR #57 Created**: Fixed all 5 content validation issues blocking branch protection
2. ✅ **Architecture Vision**: Documented cloud-only collection strategy
3. ✅ **Security Strategy**: Comprehensive secrets scanning & validation approach
4. ✅ **Metadata Schema**: Progressive tier system for future enhancements

### Important Decisions Made

#### Unique ID Format Update
```
# New format includes content type:
{type}_{name}_{author}_{datetime}
persona_creative-writer_johndoe_20250718-143025
```

#### Security Scanning Levels
- **REJECT**: API keys, credit cards, private keys (block submission)
- **WARN**: Emails, phone numbers, IPs (require confirmation)
- **INFO**: UUIDs, hashes (log only)

#### Progressive Metadata
- **Tier 1**: Minimal required fields (ready now)
- **Tier 2**: Discovery features (taglines, keywords)
- **Tier 3**: Performance metrics (for automation)
- **Tier 4**: Community features (future)

### Branch Protection Status
- **Blocker Fixed**: 5 content validation issues resolved
- **PR #57**: Awaiting CI checks and merge
- **Ready for Protection**: Once PR merged, can enable immediately

### Key Decisions for Next Session
1. **Unique ID Format**: `{type}_{name}_{author}_{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}`
2. **Progressive Metadata**: 4-tier system, start minimal
3. **Security Scanning**: Two-layer (local + cloud) with 3 severity levels
4. **Architecture**: Collection is cloud-only, MCP server handles runtime

### Uncommitted Docs
- PROGRESSIVE_METADATA_SCHEMA.md (updated with datetime)
- SECURITY_AND_VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md
- VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md (updated with datetime)
- Session summaries

**Remember**: Update PR #57 with new docs before merging!

### Future Performance Enhancements (Tracked in Issues)
- **Issue #54**: LRU cache for line splitting optimization
- **Issue #55**: ReDoS complexity analysis for pattern ordering
- **Issue #56**: Adaptive search strategy for line detection

### 🎉 **Security Scanner Production Ready!**
- **48 Security Patterns**: Comprehensive AI/LLM threat detection
- **197 Tests Passing**: Including unit, integration, security, and stress tests  
- **Performance Optimized**: ~0.02ms per pattern with early exit strategies
- **Production Robust**: Error handling, graceful fallbacks, stress tested
- **Full Documentation**: Performance guide and best practices included

### Important Reminders
- **TYPE SAFETY CRITICAL**: No `any` types - use proper interfaces (CI fails on this)
- **PR Review**: Push code + description together for visibility
- **ReDoS Prevention**: Avoid unbounded repetition in regex patterns
- **Test Categories**: Use consistent category names (e.g., 'jailbreak' not 'jailbreaking')
- **Performance**: Keep pattern matching under 0.1ms average
- **Security Testing Safety**: Use placeholders first - real patterns can trigger exits!
- **Pattern Conflicts**: Check for overlapping patterns (e.g., exec in multiple patterns)
- **Schema Validation**: Placeholders must match `^[A-Z_]+$` (no numbers!)
- **CI vs Local**: Tests may pass locally but fail in CI - check environment differences
