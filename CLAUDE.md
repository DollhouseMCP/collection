# Claude Context Notes - DollhouseMCP Collection Repository

## Current Status: PR #27 - Integration Test Suite

### PR Details
- **Branch**: feat/integration-tests
- **URL**: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/collection/pull/27
- **Status**: Open, CI failing some tests, Claude approved with minor issues
- **Files**: 6 changed, 1,600+ insertions

### What's in PR #27
1. **content-lifecycle.test.ts** (523 lines)
   - Full content validation workflows
   - Security pattern detection
   - Batch processing tests
   - Real library validation

2. **cli-validation.test.ts** (432 lines)
   - CLI tool integration
   - Glob patterns, JSON reports
   - Performance testing

3. **security-workflow.test.ts** (570 lines)
   - Security validation pipeline
   - Pattern-specific tests
   - False positive handling

4. **Bug Fix**: CLI JSON report generation (validate-content.ts)
   - Fixed OUTPUT_FILE environment variable handling

### Test Status
- **Passing**: 20/32 tests
- **Failing**: 12 tests (mostly expectation mismatches)
- **Key Issues**:
  - Library has 5 files with validation errors
  - Security pattern detection expectations need adjustment
  - Some test assertions don't match actual behavior

### Claude's Review Feedback
- Overall positive review
- Suggests adjusting test expectations rather than changing code
- Minor issues to address before merge

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fix failing tests in PR #27**
   - Adjust expectations to match actual behavior
   - Don't change production code unless necessary
   
2. **Address Claude's minor feedback**
   - Review specific suggestions in PR comments
   
3. **Get PR #27 merged**
   - All tests should pass
   - CI checks green

### Known Issues to Track
1. **Library Content Problems** (5 files failing validation):
   - Check with: `npm run validate:content library/**/*.md`
   - Likely missing required fields or format issues
   
2. **Security Pattern Detection**:
   - Some patterns not triggering as expected
   - May need to refine regex patterns
   
3. **Test Environment**:
   - Uses .test-tmp directory
   - Some tests leave artifacts between runs

### Technical Context
- **Node**: v24.1.0 (experimental VM modules warning is normal)
- **Jest**: Using ESM with experimental flags
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no-explicit-any enforced

### Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view 27

# Run failing tests locally
npm run test:integration

# See which library files fail
npm run validate:content library/**/*.md

# Check specific test
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should detect and flag security issues"
```

### File Locations
- Integration tests: `test/integration/`
- CLI tool: `src/cli/validate-content.ts`
- Validators: `src/validators/`
- Library content: `library/`

### Branch Protection Note
- Always work in feature branches
- Create PRs for all changes
- Claude bot reviews automatically
- GitHub push protection is active (caught test API keys)

## Session Summary
- Successfully created comprehensive integration test suite
- Fixed CLI bug discovered during testing
- Created proper PR (#27) after initially working on main
- Tests revealed library content issues needing attention
- Good security - push protection caught test secrets

## Priority for Next Session
1. Get PR #27 tests passing and merged
2. Fix the 5 library content files
3. Consider writing unit tests for security patterns
4. Review any new PRs or issues
