### Recent Accomplishments (July 17, 2025 Final Session)
- ✅ **Security Test Series**: 8/8 PRs successfully merged (190+ security tests)
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Pattern ordering, early exit, caching (~0.02ms per pattern)
- ✅ **Production Robustness**: Added error handling, stress testing, graceful fallbacks
- ✅ **CI Build Fixes**: Resolved flaky performance tests, all builds green
- ✅ **Future Enhancement Issues**: Created #54, #55, #56 for performance optimizations

#### PR #5 - Zod v3.24.1 → v4.0.5 ✅ SOLVED
**Solution Found**: One-line backward compatibility fix
```typescript
// Line 237 in src/validators/content-validator.ts
const isMissingField = err.code === 'invalid_type' && 
  (('received' in err && err.received === 'undefined') || 
   (!('received' in err) && err.message.includes('received undefined')));
```
**Status**: Ready to merge with this fix applied

#### PR #2 - GitHub Action Update (peter-evans/create-pull-request)
**Status**: Not reviewed yet, low risk

#### PR #1 - GitHub Action Update (tj-actions/changed-files)
**Status**: Not reviewed yet, low risk

### ✅ Security Test Implementation Series (8/8 COMPLETE!)
1. ✅ PR #38: Fix prompt injection tests  
2. ✅ PR #39: Safe test infrastructure
3. ✅ PR #40: Jailbreaking patterns
4. ✅ PR #42: Command execution patterns
5. ✅ PR #43: Data exfiltration patterns
6. ✅ PR #45: Context awareness patterns
7. ✅ PR #48: Remaining categories
8. ✅ PR #50: Performance optimization **[FINAL - MERGED]**

### High Priority Tasks (GitHub Issues)
1. **Issue #32**: Fix library content validation issues (5 files)
2. **Issue #33**: Write comprehensive security tests ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Issue #34**: Create proper CLI validation tool with enhanced features

### Medium Priority Tasks (From Claude Reviews)
1. **Issue #28**: Improve CLI test robustness with timeouts
2. **Issue #29**: Make security test assertions more specific
3. **Issue #30**: Add flexible content validation handling
4. **Issue #31**: Clean up magic numbers

### Key Technical Context

#### Windows CLI Fix Pattern (PR #27)
Instead of using spawn() which fails on Windows:
```typescript
// Import and call directly
import { main as validateContent } from '../../dist/src/cli/validate-content.js';
const exitCode = await validateContent(args);
```

#### Security Pattern Context
This project detects AI/LLM security issues, NOT traditional web security:
- ✅ Prompt injection, command execution, jailbreaking
- ❌ SQL injection, XSS, traditional vulnerabilities

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr list

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Check failing library content
npm run validate:content library/**/*.md

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:security

# Run specific security test
npm run test:security -- test/security/data-exfiltration.test.ts

# Check for ReDoS vulnerabilities
# Look for patterns with *, +, or {n,} without upper bounds
grep -E '(\*|\+|\{[0-9]+,\})' src/validators/security-patterns.ts
```

### Session History
- **July 16 AM**: Fixed Windows CLI tests, created follow-up issues
- **July 16 PM**: Investigated Dependabot PRs, solved Zod v4 compatibility
- **July 17 AM**: Implemented TDD security tests (PRs #38-40, #42), fixed ReDoS vulnerability
- **July 17 PM**: Completed PRs #43, #45, #48 - 173 security tests passing!
- **July 17 FINAL**: 🎉 **COMPLETED 8/8 Security Series** - Merged PR #50 with production robustness

### Next Session Focus
1. **Issue #32** - Fix library content validation issues (5 files)
2. **Issue #34** - Create proper CLI validation tool with enhanced features
3. **Dependabot PRs** - Review and merge (#1, #2, #5) when time permits

### Future Performance Enhancements (Tracked in Issues)
- **Issue #54**: LRU cache for line splitting optimization
- **Issue #55**: ReDoS complexity analysis for pattern ordering
- **Issue #56**: Adaptive search strategy for line detection

### 🎉 **Security Scanner Production Ready!**
- **48 Security Patterns**: Comprehensive AI/LLM threat detection
- **197 Tests Passing**: Including unit, integration, security, and stress tests  
- **Performance Optimized**: ~0.02ms per pattern with early exit strategies
- **Production Robust**: Error handling, graceful fallbacks, stress tested
- **Full Documentation**: Performance guide and best practices included

### Important Reminders
- **TYPE SAFETY CRITICAL**: No `any` types - use proper interfaces (CI fails on this)
- **PR Review**: Push code + description together for visibility
- **ReDoS Prevention**: Avoid unbounded repetition in regex patterns
- **Test Categories**: Use consistent category names (e.g., 'jailbreak' not 'jailbreaking')
- **Performance**: Keep pattern matching under 0.1ms average
- **Security Testing Safety**: Use placeholders first - real patterns can trigger exits!
- **Pattern Conflicts**: Check for overlapping patterns (e.g., exec in multiple patterns)
- **Schema Validation**: Placeholders must match `^[A-Z_]+$` (no numbers!)
- **CI vs Local**: Tests may pass locally but fail in CI - check environment differences
